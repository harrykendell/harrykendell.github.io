<!-- # Oars -->

<!-- Nearly all new blades are Skinnies, with older ones generally being Ultralight or Low I, and a range of blade shapes. Ideally we standardise over time to allow mixing and matching sets. The biggest factors in maintaining blades are cleaning handles and using vortex tips to prevent scraping spoons.

The main maintenance tasks are replacing handles (including dealing with end caps popping out) and dealing with spoon deterioration. Major damage is usually handled by Concept2 at a major regatta; this should be arranged in advance where possible.

## Handles

Replacing handles is relatively easy for modern C2 ones, although we have some older handles that are directly epoxied on. Suede grips are epoxied on; the suede should be removed, not the entire handle.

> [!INFO] Handle Types
>
> There are two incompatible types of handle. Old Ultralights use the [larger handle][c2-large], while new oars or Skinnies / sculls need the [standard handle][c2-standard].

### Suede replacement

Suede squares need to be fitted so that the seam does not cause blisters, and should be the correct size for [sculls][c2-sculls] or sweep [inside][c2-inside] / [outside][c2-outside]. They can be removed with a heat gun and patience; clean the surface with IPA before installing replacements. Replacement patches are self-adhesive.

### Green rubber replacement

Green grips must be unscrewed and fully replaced. If the end cap of the oar comes off with the grip, epoxy it back in place with Araldite, taking care with rotational alignment.

### Fixed handle replacement

Fixed-handle blades and inner green grips can be replaced similarly: remove the old grip, clean, and epoxy the new one in place.

## Sleeves

    title="Sleeves">
  </iframe>
</div>
Sleeves are epoxied on and must be oriented correctly to set blade pitch. Concept2 provide a pitch jig, but you can also use a flat reference surface. In practice, the back face of the blade should align with the P/S marking (port/starboard). Ensure the sleeve is positioned at the correct distance from the spoon for the desired gearing.

## Spoons

For delamination or breakage, stabilise with epoxy:

# Oars and blades

## Oars

Nearly all new blades are Skinnies, with older ones generally being Ultralight or Low I, and a range of blade shapes. Standardising over time improves mix-and-match and reduces spares complexity.

### Handling rules (prevents 80% of damage)

- Never push off a dock with the blade.
- Avoid scraping spoon tips; use protective vortex tips/edge protection if available.
- Store oars on racks with support at approved points; avoid direct sun long-term.
- Rinse after saltwater; wipe grips and sleeves.

> [!WARNING] Stop-use criteria (oars)
>
> - Shaft crack, soft spot, or “crunching” under flex.
> - Blade-to-shaft joint damage.
> - Major delamination that can be flexed by hand.

### Handles

> [!INFO] Handle Types
> There are two incompatible types of handle. Old Ultralights use the [larger handle](https://www.concept2.co.uk/product/168), while new oars or Skinnies/sculls need the [standard handle](https://www.concept2.co.uk/product/62).

### When to send to manufacturer

Concept2 also runs **Regatta Service** at select events (complimentary repairs/maintenance for Concept2 oars):
- [Concept2 Regatta Service](https://www.concept2.com/support/oars/about-regatta-service)

- Large shaft damage.
- Blade-to-shaft joint failure.
- Major spoon structural damage.
- Any repair that would materially change stiffness/weight balance.

Note: Our club insurance policy treats oars as paired equipment; a single written-off blade allows for a repalcement pair.
