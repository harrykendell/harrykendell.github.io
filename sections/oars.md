# Oars and blades

## Oars

Nearly all new blades are Skinnies, with older ones generally being Ultralight or Low I, and a range of blade shapes. Standardising over time improves mix-and-match and reduces spares complexity.

### Handling rules (prevents 80% of damage)

- Never push off a dock with the blade.
- Avoid scraping spoon tips; use protective vortex tips/edge protection if available.
- Store oars on racks with support at approved points; avoid direct sun long-term.
- Rinse after saltwater; wipe grips and sleeves.

> [!WARNING] Stop-use criteria (oars)
>
> - Shaft crack, soft spot, or “crunching” under flex.
> - Blade-to-shaft joint damage.
> - Major delamination that can be flexed by hand.

### Handles

> [!INFO] Handle Types
> There are two incompatible types of handle. Old Ultralights use the [larger handle](https://www.concept2.co.uk/product/168), while new oars or Skinnies/sculls need the [standard handle](https://www.concept2.co.uk/product/62).

[!PROCEDURE:Intermediate]] Replace suede patch
Replace worn or torn suede grip patches to maintain comfort and prevent blisters. Use gentle heat and keep the gun moving to avoid overheating the carbon.

**Tools:** Heat gun, IPA, replacement patches

**Steps:**

1. Warm the suede gently and peel off.
2. Clean adhesive residue with IPA and let it dry.
3. Fit the correct patch size (sculls or sweep inside/outside).
4. Place the seam away from pressure points to prevent blisters.

**Check:** Patch fully bonded; seam placement acceptable. Do when suede is worn, torn, or lifting.

[!PROCEDURE:Intermediate]] Replace green rubber grip
Replace a torn, slippery, or loose green grip to restore comfort and control. If the end cap comes off with the grip, epoxy it back in place with the correct rotational alignment before fitting the new grip.

**Tools:** Replacement grip, epoxy (e.g., Araldite) for end cap if needed

**Steps:**

1. Unscrew and remove the old grip.
2. If the end cap comes off: clean mating surfaces and epoxy it back with correct rotational alignment; allow full cure.
3. Fit the new grip and tighten fully.

**Check:** No rotation under load. Replace when grip is torn, slippery, or loose.

[!PROCEDURE:Advanced]] Fixed handle replacement (legacy)
Replace a fixed handle or inner grip on legacy oars. This is higher risk than screw-on grips: if you cannot remove the old handle without damaging the shaft, stop and arrange manufacturer repair.

**Tools:** New fixed handle, epoxy, heat tools as needed

**Steps:**

1. Confirm you have the correct replacement handle and orientation marks.
2. Remove the old handle carefully (avoid cutting into the shaft).
3. Clean and prepare the bonding surface.
4. Bond the new handle with correct alignment; keep it fixed until fully cured.

**Check:** Handle alignment correct; no play or twist after cure.

## Sleeves

Sleeves are epoxied on and must be oriented correctly to set blade pitch. Concept2 provide a pitch jig, but you can also use a flat reference surface. In practice, the back face of the blade should align with the P/S marking (port/starboard). Ensure the sleeve is positioned at the correct distance from the spoon for the desired gearing.

[!PROCEDURE:Advanced]] Sleeve replacement and pitch alignment
Replace a worn, rotated, or cracked sleeve and restore correct pitch alignment. Pitch errors ruin rigging consistency; if you cannot restore alignment or the shaft is damaged, send to the manufacturer.

**Tools:** Sleeve kit, epoxy/adhesive per manufacturer, pitch jig or flat reference

**Steps:**

1. Measure and mark the current sleeve position and orientation relative to the blade.
2. Remove the old sleeve carefully (avoid cutting into the shaft).
3. Clean the shaft and dry fit the new sleeve at the correct distance for the required gearing.
4. Apply adhesive, slide on the sleeve, and align pitch (back face of blade aligns with the P/S marking) using a jig or flat reference.
5. Hold alignment until full cure.

**Check:** Sleeve secure; pitch alignment correct; distance correct for gearing.

[!PROCEDURE:Intermediate]] Collar inspection and re-set
Monthly check that collars are tight and that inboard is consistent across a pair or scull set.

**Tools:** Marker, tape measure, collar tools appropriate to model, spare collars/clams if used

**Steps:**

1. Check collar condition and tightness (cracks, slipping marks, deformed wear surfaces).
2. Measure inboard and compare across the set; mark a reference line on the shaft for quick visual checks.
3. If the collar has moved: reset to the correct inboard and secure per that collar type (clamp/tape/clams).

**Check:** Inboard consistent across the set; collar does not slip under load.
[!/PROCEDURE]

## Spoons

For delamination or breakage, stabilise with epoxy:

[!PROCEDURE:Intermediate]] Stabilise spoon delamination (inject epoxy)
Early intervention on spoon delamination to prevent blade failure and structural damage. For large delamination, structural cracks, or blade-to-shaft joint issues, arrange manufacturer repair.

**Tools:** Epoxy, syringe, clamps/weights, release film

**Steps:**

1. Clean and dry the area thoroughly.
2. Inject epoxy into the delamination.
3. Clamp/weight to restore shape and hold until cure (use release film where needed).
4. Sand/fair lightly if needed.

**Check:** No flex; sealed edges. Do when early delamination or edge damage is observed.

### When to send to manufacturer

Concept2 also runs **Regatta Service** at select events (complimentary repairs/maintenance for Concept2 oars):

- [Concept2 Regatta Service](https://www.concept2.com/support/oars/about-regatta-service)

- Large shaft damage.
- Blade-to-shaft joint failure.
- Major spoon structural damage.
- Any repair that would materially change stiffness/weight balance.

Note: Our club insurance policy treats oars as paired equipment; a single written-off blade allows for a replacement pair.
