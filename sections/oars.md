<!-- # Oars -->

<!-- Nearly all new blades are Skinnies, with older ones generally being Ultralight or Low I, and a range of blade shapes. Ideally we standardise over time to allow mixing and matching sets. The biggest factors in maintaining blades are cleaning handles and using vortex tips to prevent scraping spoons.

The main maintenance tasks are replacing handles (including dealing with end caps popping out) and dealing with spoon deterioration. Major damage is usually handled by Concept2 at a major regatta; this should be arranged in advance where possible.

## Handles

Replacing handles is relatively easy for modern C2 ones, although we have some older handles that are directly epoxied on. Suede grips are epoxied on; the suede should be removed, not the entire handle.

> [!INFO] Handle Types
>
> There are two incompatible types of handle. Old Ultralights use the [larger handle][c2-large], while new oars or Skinnies / sculls need the [standard handle][c2-standard].

Suede squares need to be fitted so that the seam does not cause blisters, and should be the correct size for [sculls][c2-sculls] or sweep [inside][c2-inside] / [outside][c2-outside]. They can be removed with a heat gun and patience; clean the surface with IPA before installing replacements. Replacement patches are self-adhesive.

### Green rubber replacement

Green grips must be unscrewed and fully replaced. If the end cap of the oar comes off with the grip, epoxy it back in place with Araldite, taking care with rotational alignment.

### Fixed handle replacement

Fixed-handle blades and inner green grips can be replaced similarly: remove the old grip, clean, and epoxy the new one in place.

## Sleeves

</div>
Sleeves are epoxied on and must be oriented correctly to set blade pitch. Concept2 provide a pitch jig, but you can also use a flat reference surface. In practice, the back face of the blade should align with the P/S marking (port/starboard). Ensure the sleeve is positioned at the correct distance from the spoon for the desired gearing.

## Spoons

For delamination or breakage, stabilise with epoxy:

# Oars and blades

## Oars

Nearly all new blades are Skinnies, with older ones generally being Ultralight or Low I, and a range of blade shapes. Standardising over time improves mix-and-match and reduces spares complexity.

### Handling rules (prevents 80% of damage)

- Never push off a dock with the blade.
- Avoid scraping spoon tips; use protective vortex tips/edge protection if available.
- Store oars on racks with support at approved points; avoid direct sun long-term.
- Rinse after saltwater; wipe grips and sleeves.

> [!WARNING] Stop-use criteria (oars)
>
> - Shaft crack, soft spot, or “crunching” under flex.
> - Blade-to-shaft joint damage.
> - Major delamination that can be flexed by hand.

### Handles

> [!INFO] Handle Types
> There are two incompatible types of handle. Old Ultralights use the [larger handle](https://www.concept2.co.uk/product/168), while new oars or Skinnies/sculls need the [standard handle](https://www.concept2.co.uk/product/62).

**Procedure: Replace suede patch**

- **Skill level:** Intermediate
- **When to do it:** when suede is worn, torn, or lifting
- **Tools & materials:** heat gun, IPA, replacement patches
- **Safety:** do not overheat carbon; avoid fumes
- **Steps:**
  1. Warm suede gently and peel off.
  2. Clean adhesive residue with IPA.
  3. Fit correct patch size: [sculls](https://www.concept2.co.uk/product/448) or sweep [inside](https://www.concept2.co.uk/product/174) / [outside](https://www.concept2.co.uk/product/173).
  4. Place seam away from pressure points to prevent blisters.
- **Checks:** patch fully bonded; seam placement acceptable

**Procedure: Replace green rubber grip**

- **Skill level:** Intermediate
- **When to do it:** grip is torn, slippery, or loose
- **Tools & materials:** replacement grip, epoxy (e.g., Araldite) for end cap if needed
- **Steps:**
  1. Unscrew and remove old grip.
  2. If end cap comes off: epoxy it back with correct rotational alignment.
  3. Fit new grip; ensure secure.
- **Checks:** no rotation under load

**Procedure: Fixed handle replacement (legacy)**

- **Skill level:** Intermediate → Professional
- **When to do it:** fixed handle or inner grip damaged
- **Notes:** higher risk of damaging shaft; follow manufacturer guidance where possible.

### Sleeves

**Procedure: Sleeve replacement and pitch alignment**

- **Skill level:** Professional
- **When to do it:** sleeve worn, rotated, cracked
- **Tools & materials:** sleeve kit, epoxy/adhesive per manufacturer, pitch jig or flat reference
- **Safety:** alignment is critical; incorrect pitch ruins rigging
- **Steps:**
  1. Mark current orientation relative to blade.
  2. Remove sleeve carefully (avoid cutting into shaft).
  3. Clean shaft; dry fit new sleeve at correct distance.
  4. Apply adhesive; align pitch (back face of blade aligns with P/S marking).
  5. Hold alignment until cure.
- **Checks:** pitch correct; sleeve secure; distance correct for gearing

### Spoons

**Procedure: Stabilise spoon delamination (inject epoxy)**

- **Skill level:** Intermediate
- **When to do it:** early delamination or edge damage
- **Tools & materials:** epoxy, syringe, clamps/weights, release film
- **Steps:**
  1. Clean and dry.
  2. Inject epoxy into delam.
  3. Clamp to restore shape; cure.
  4. Sand/fair lightly if needed.
- **Checks:** no flex; sealed edges
- **Escalation:** large delam or structural cracks → arrange manufacturer repair

### When to send to manufacturer

- Large shaft damage.
- Blade-to-shaft joint failure.
- Major spoon structural damage.
- Any repair that would materially change stiffness/weight balance.

NB insurance on blades covers both if one is written off from a pair
