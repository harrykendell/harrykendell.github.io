## Appendix B — Diagnostic flowcharts

**B1. Seat doesn’t roll smoothly**

- Clean tracks and wheels.
  - If fixed → done.
  - If not:
    - Remove seat.
      - If wheel flat spot → replace wheels (set).
      - If wheel grinding → replace wheel/bearing.
      - If track loose/misaligned → re-tighten/align.
      - If inserts spinning → stop-use and repair insert area.

**B2. Gate rattles or feels loose**

- Check top nut tight.
  - If loose → tighten and re-check.
  - If tight:
    - Disassemble and confirm washer stack present.
    - Add/remove thin washers to remove vertical play.
    - Inspect pitch bushings for wear.
    - If pin bent or threads damaged → replace pin.

**B3. Boat pulls to one side (steering)**

- Check rudder is centred when toe centred.
  - If not → adjust cable lengths.
- Check cable tension and routing (no snags).
- Check rudder yoke attachment.
- Check fin is straight and secure.

**B4. Coxbox issues**

- No rate:
  - Test A–D continuity to sensor.
  - Short A–D manually; if coxbox shows rate → sensor/magnet alignment.
- No speakers:
  - Test B–C continuity/load.
  - Inspect speaker pick-off connectors.
- No charging:
  - Test D–E for charger voltage.

- Oar length:
- Inboard:
- Gate height:
- Pitch (gate):
- Rigger type and settings (if adjustable):
- Footplate numbers for common athletes (optional):

## Appendix F — Photo library and damage gallery

Recommended folder structure:

- `imgs/boats/` (hull damage, scarf examples, fin box)
- `imgs/gates/` (washer stacks, worn bushings)
- `imgs/seats/` (wheel wear, track inserts)
- `imgs/footplates/` (heel ties, steering routing)
- `imgs/oars/` (delamination, sleeve alignment marks)
- `imgs/electronics/` (pinouts, corrosion examples)

Minimum “damage gallery” set:

| Failure mode | Photo to capture | Why it helps |
|---|---|---|
| Hull puncture | outside + inside + scale | distinguishes skin vs core damage |
| Delamination | tap boundary marked | lets you monitor growth |
| Fin box damage | fin + box area + inside access | high risk water ingress |
| Gate rattle | washer stack laid out | ensures reassembly repeatability |
| Seat issue | wheel close-up + track mount | identifies flats vs loose inserts |
| Steering issue | rudder centred + toe centred | speeds cable adjustment |
| Cox wiring | plug face + keyway | avoids pinout errors |

## Appendix G — Recommended products and standards

This is a **standards list** (what type) rather than a shopping list (which changes).

**Cleaning**

- Mild soap + microfibre (default).
- Diluted vinegar for limescale (rinse thoroughly).
- Contact cleaner for corroded electrical pins.

**Mechanical**

- A2 stainless minimum; A4 preferred for marine/salt.
- Nyloc nuts for vibration-prone joints.
- Anti-seize only where stainless meets aluminium threads (use sparingly).

**Composites**

- Marine epoxy system for structural work (with appropriate hardener).
- Structural filler (high strength) for bonding; fairing filler for cosmetic shaping.
- Peel ply + perf film + breather for vacuum bagging.
- Air-dry paint system for touch-up when 2K spraying is not available.

**Electrical**

- Adhesive-lined heat shrink for sealing and strain relief.
- Proper ratcheting crimper matched to contact series.
- Dielectric grease (very light) to reduce corrosion at exposed plugs.
