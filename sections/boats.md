<!-- # Boats

## Boat care & routine maintenance

To keep boats in good condition there are a number of routine tasks we should be doing.

#### Every outing

- Wash inside and out with soap and then fresh water, and wipe dry with a micro-fibre cloth:
  - Hull
  - Riggers
  - Runners

#### Maintenance days

- Remove hardware, clean, and check for missing washers.
- Check for cracks in seats, riggers, and footplates.
- Clean hull with Starbrite Hull Cleaner (wash off thoroughly afterwards).
- Remove limescale with diluted vinegar (wash off thoroughly afterwards).

#### Periodically

- Machine-polish with fine-cut compound on a foam pad at low RPM.

We try to do minor repairs in-house to avoid the high cost of sending boats away. Many repairers have minimum quotes of about GBP 450 and our insurance excess is GBP 250. For nicer boats it can still be worth sending them away for major work.

#### Construction

The boats are generally built with a composite sandwich structure with carbon/kevlar skins of roughly 3 x 200 g plies and a Nomex honeycomb core. When originally made this will be prepreg under vacuum in an autoclave. This is then covered with either 2K automotive-style paint or gelcoat in some older/cheaper cases.

This creates complications for repairs: we cannot safely use 2K paints without a spray booth, and we cannot bake boats at high temperature. However, we can do vacuum-bagged wet layups and we have carbon, core material, and decent quality aerosol paints available.

# Boats

## Routine care & cleaning

[!PROCEDURE:Beginner]] Post-outing wash-down
Routine rinse and wash to remove salt, algae, and grit after every outing. This prevents corrosion, mould, and deterioration of seals. Avoid pressure-washing near seams, decals, or hatch seals; leaving salt causes corrosion; leaving water causes mould and seized hardware.

**Tools:** Hose, bucket, mild soap, microfibre cloths

**Steps:**

1. Rinse hull, riggers, and runners/tracks with fresh water.
2. Wash with mild soap (inside and outside), then rinse thoroughly.
3. Wipe dry with microfibre cloth (especially runners and inside cockpit).
4. Open bow/stern hatches briefly to ventilate. Close once dry.
5. Quick visual check: fin/rudder, obvious scratches, loose hardware.

> [!INFO] Check for Damage
> Report and tag the boat if you see cracks, soft spots, or other damage
[!/PROCEDURE]
<!-- > **Check:** No standing water; tracks feel smooth; no new obvious cracks. Report and tag the boat if you see cracks, soft spots, or impact damage. -->

[!PROCEDURE:Intermediate]] Maintenance day deep-clean
Weekly or biweekly deep clean with hardware inspection and removal to prevent corrosion and catch loose fasteners early. Gloves/eye protection for cleaners; reassembly mistakes on washer order; over-cleaning with aggressive chemicals.

**Tools:** Standard tool kit, brushes, microfibres, vinegar (dilute), hull cleaner (optional), replacement washers, nyloc nuts as needed

**Steps:**

1. Remove seats and clean wheels/tracks.
2. Remove selected hardware (rigger bolts, key fasteners) and check for missing washers.
3. Inspect for cracks in seats, riggers, footplates.
4. Remove limescale with diluted vinegar; rinse thoroughly.
5. If using a hull cleaner (e.g., Starbrite): apply briefly, scrub lightly, rinse thoroughly.

**Check:** No missing washers; all critical bolts tightened; steering functional. Stripped inserts, seized bolts, or any structural cracking → escalate to equipment officer.
[!/PROCEDURE]

[!PROCEDURE:Intermediate]] Periodic polish
Machine polish the hull at end-of-season to restore finish and protect against UV and salt staining. Eye protection; keep cables clear of water; do not overheat paint.

**Tools:** Fine-cut compound, foam pad, low-RPM polisher, microfibres, wax (if used)

**Steps:**

1. Wash and dry the hull completely.
2. Machine polish at low RPM, keeping the pad moving.
3. Wipe residue and inspect. Repeat lightly if needed.
4. Apply wax/sealant if part of club policy.

**Check:** Finish restored without burn-through. If paint is thin or you see primer/carbon, stop and plan professional repaint.
[!/PROCEDURE]

## Storage and transport

**Storage rules (always):**

- Store indoors where possible; avoid long-term UV exposure.
- Support boats on correct slings/trestles at approved points.
- Keep hatches closed during storage (after drying) to prevent pests and humidity cycling.
- Do not store with riggers bearing abnormal loads; avoid leaning shells against hard edges.

[!PROCEDURE:Beginner]] Trailer loading and transport
Safe loading onto a trailer to prevent damage during transport. Proper support and strapping prevents hull flexing and protects critical components. Pinch points; overhead hazards; avoid strap crush on decks; if the boat flexes under straps, stop and re-rig the support points.

**Tools:** Straps, padding, fin/rudder protectors, tape

**Steps:**

1. Confirm fin/rudder clearance and protection (remove fin/rudder if manufacturer allows and transport demands it).
2. Place hull in cradles; ensure contact points are padded.
3. Strap snugly (no deck crushing). Use bow/stern lines to prevent fore-aft movement.
4. Secure loose riggers or remove if required.
5. After 10–15 minutes driving, stop and re-check strap tension.

**Check:** No movement; fin/rudder protected. Requires supervision for large boats. This is a beginner procedure with supervision.
[!/PROCEDURE]

## Buoyancy compartments, hatch covers, and bungs (safety-critical)

Water ingress is the hidden killer: it turns minor damage into major repairs and can make a boat unsafe in a capsize.

[!PROCEDURE:Beginner]] Buoyancy and hatch check
Safety-critical check that buoyancy compartments are watertight and that hatch covers and bungs are present and functional. Missing hatch cover, missing bung, or a compartment that will not seal: stop-use. Water sloshing in a sealed compartment (unknown leak): stop-use.

**Tools:** Towel, flashlight, spare hatch cover seal (if available)

**Steps:**

1. Confirm bow/stern hatch covers are present, seated fully, and not cracked.
2. Check seals/O-rings: clean, not split, and lightly lubricated only if manufacturer recommends.
3. Confirm any bungs/vent plugs are present and tightened appropriately.
4. Shine a light inside the compartment: look for standing water, mould, or salt residue.
5. If water is present: drain/dry and find the leak (fin box, hatch seal, impact damage).

**Check:** Covers secure; seals intact; compartments dry. Do this before every outing (quick check) and monthly (detailed check). If persistent water ingress, inspect fin box and hull; treat as structural risk.
[!/PROCEDURE]

> [!WARNING] Stop-use criteria (buoyancy)
>
> - Missing hatch cover, missing bung, or a compartment that will not seal.
> - Water sloshing in a sealed compartment (unknown leak).

## Riggers, stays, and structural attachments

Riggers, pins, and stays are the primary load path from athlete → boat. Failures here are safety-critical and often cascade into hull damage.

[!PROCEDURE:Intermediate]] Rigger and stay inspection
Monthly inspection of riggers, pins, and stays to catch movement, cracking, or corrosion before failure. Do this after transport or any impact/bridge strike.

**Tools:** Spanners/Allen keys, spare washers/nuts, marker, straight edge

**Steps:**

1. Check each rigger for visible bends, cracks, or chipped paint exposing aluminium.
2. Try to rock the rigger at the hull interface: there should be **no movement**.
3. Inspect stay wires (where fitted): look for fraying, broken strands, kinks, or loose swages.
4. Confirm washer stacks are present and identical left/right where expected.
5. Re-tighten fasteners as required (snug; do not crush the hull). Replace any nylocs that spin freely.
6. Mark “witness lines” on key nuts/bolts so loosening is obvious.

**Check:** No movement at mounts; no cracking; stays taut and undamaged.

**Common failure modes:** Missing washers → crushed deck; corrosion under paint; hidden cracks at welds.

**Escalation:** Any crack, bend, or movement → stop-use; do not “row it gently”.
[!/PROCEDURE]

## Fin, rudder, and fin box

Fins/rudders are frequently damaged during launching, shallow water, and transport. Fin box damage is high-risk for water ingress.

[!PROCEDURE:Beginner]] Fin + rudder quick check
Pre-outing check that the fin and rudder are secure and aligned. This prevents damage during rowing and ensures steering responsiveness. Looseness, binding, or new cracks around fin box: stop-use. Suspected structural fin box damage: escalate to professional repair (common cause of repeat leaks).

**Tools:** None

**Steps:**

1. Confirm fin is fully seated and set screws (if used) are tight.
2. Confirm rudder is securely attached and moves smoothly through full travel.
3. Centre the rudder and confirm alignment with the fin.
4. Check for play: fin/rudder should not wobble relative to the hull.

**Check:** Secure; aligned; smooth travel. Do this before every outing in steered boats.
[!/PROCEDURE]

[!PROCEDURE:Intermediate]] Fin box leak check (after damage)
After a fin strike or when unexplained water appears in buoyancy compartments, check the fin box for structural damage and cracks that could cause water ingress.

**Tools:** Towel, flashlight, marker, low-pressure leak test method (optional)

**Steps:**

1. Dry everything thoroughly.
2. Inspect inside access (if available) for cracking, lifted laminate, or staining.
3. Mark any cracks; do not launch until sealed and assessed.

**Check:** Any damage found should be escalated to professional repair.
[!/PROCEDURE]

## Inspection and damage triage

> [!WARNING] Stop-use criteria (shell)
> Take the boat **out of service immediately** if any of the following are true:
>
> - Cracks radiating from rigger mounting areas or along structural ribs.
> - Any **soft spot** that is growing, especially on the hull near the waterline or near the fin box.
> - Fin box movement, cracking, or leaking (water ingress).
> - Seat track mounts/inserts moving or pulling out.
> - Delamination you can flex by hand, or that sounds “dead” in a tap test over a large area.
> - Any puncture where core is exposed and has been wet.

[!PROCEDURE:Intermediate]] Damage triage (cosmetic vs structural)
Assess damage after any impact or when new damage is observed to decide if it is cosmetic or structural.

**Tools:** Bright light, marker/tape, camera, coin/tap hammer, ruler

**Safety:** Gloves if fibres exposed

**Steps:**

1. Clean the area; damage is hard to classify when dirty.
2. Photograph with a scale (ruler/coin). Mark the boundary with tape.
3. Tap test outward from the damage: listen for change from “sharp” to “dull”.
4. Check both sides (inside cockpit and outside hull) if accessible.
5. Classify:

- **Cosmetic:** paint/gelcoat scratch with no fibre break, no soft spot.
- **Minor structural:** shallow fibre damage limited area, no core crush.
- **Structural:** core crush, delamination, cracks through skin, puncture.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD029 -->
6. Decide next action: seal-and-monitor / in-house repair / professional repair.

**Check:** Damage logged; boat tagged appropriately.

**Common failure modes:** Underestimating hidden delamination; ignoring water ingress.

**Escalation:** Uncertain classification → treat as structural and escalate.
[!/PROCEDURE]

## Composite construction primer

Most racing shells are sandwich structures:

- **Outer and inner skins:** carbon and/or aramid (Kevlar) and/or glass fibre in multiple plies.
- **Core:** often Nomex honeycomb.
- **Finish:** 2K automotive-style paint (common in high-end shells) or gelcoat (older/cheaper builds).

Repair implications:

- You can do strong wet layups and vacuum-bagging in-house.
- You generally **cannot** replicate factory 2K paint safely without proper spray/ventilation.
- You typically **cannot** oven-cure a whole boat; cure at ambient and avoid heat damage.

**Repair decision rules (practical):**

- **Seal and monitor (in-house, fast):** hairline paint cracks, superficial scratches, tiny gelcoat chips.
- **In-house structural repair:** localised skin damage, small delamination, small punctures where core can be dried and replaced.
- **Professional repair:** large-area delamination, fin box rebuild, major core crush, long cracks near rigger mounts, any damage that changes hull shape.

## Composite repairs (procedures)

[!PROCEDURE:Beginner]] Cosmetic scratch/chip seal
Quick seal of minor paint damage and scratches to prevent water ingress and further deterioration. If fibres are broken or area feels soft: treat as structural and escalate. Do not clamp too hard or dent hull; if delam is large or near structural attachments: scarf repair or professional.

**Tools:** Fine sandpaper (400–800), IPA, small brush, epoxy or clearcoat/paint touch-up, gloves

**Steps:**

1. Clean and dry the area.
2. Lightly sand the damaged paint edge to remove sharp flaking.
3. Wipe with IPA; allow to dry.
4. Apply a thin seal coat (epoxy or matching touch-up) over exposed fibre/primer.
5. Allow to cure; lightly sand and blend if needed.

**Check:** No exposed fibre; no sharp edges. Do as soon as practical to prevent water ingress. Avoid breathing sanding dust.
[!/PROCEDURE]

[!PROCEDURE:Intermediate]] Small delamination stabilisation (inject + clamp)
Early intervention on small delaminations to prevent them from growing and becoming a major structural repair.

**Tools:** Syringe, low-viscosity epoxy, masking tape, clamps/weights, wax paper/release film, gloves

**Steps:**

1. Define boundary with tap test; mark with tape.
2. Drill a tiny injection hole at the edge of delam (only through outer skin).
3. Warm the area slightly (optional) to reduce viscosity (do not overheat).
4. Inject epoxy until it wets the delam area (watch for squeeze-out at boundary).
5. Cover with release film/wax paper and clamp/weight to restore shape.
6. Cure fully; sand/finish cosmetically.

**Check:** Tap test sounds uniform; no flex by hand. Watch for not enough epoxy penetration or clamping denting the hull.
[!/PROCEDURE]

[!PROCEDURE:Advanced]] Scarf repair (structural skin + core)
Structural repair for punctures, core crush, and structural cracks. This is advanced work; if you cannot restore shape/alignment, stop and send out.

**Tools:** Grinder/sander, vacuum, carbon cloth/tape, core, epoxy, peel ply, perforated film, breather, bag film, tacky tape, vacuum pump, fairing filler, primers/paint

**Safety:** Respirator, goggles, gloves, ventilation

**Steps:**

1. **Open up damage:** remove all broken laminate/core to sound material. Round corners.
2. **Scarf/taper:** bevel skins to a shallow taper (typical **20:1–50:1**; practical minimum **12:1** where access is limited).
3. **Dry-fit core:** cut replacement core flush with surrounding; bond in with thickened epoxy.
4. **Layup:** cut plies to fill scarf (stepped patches); wet out and lay in order.
5. **Vacuum bag:** peel ply → perf film → breather → bag. Pull vacuum and watch for resin starvation.
6. **Cure:** allow full cure (do not disturb shape).
7. **Sand/shape:** bring flush with surrounding.
8. **Fair:** apply fairing compound; sand smooth.
9. **Prime/paint:** apply compatible primer and paint (air-dry system). Blend and polish.

**Check:** Thickness matches surrounding; no hard steps; tap test uniform; finish sealed.

**Common failure modes:** Leaving damaged laminate; too-steep scarf; starving laminate under vacuum; creating a stiff “hard patch” edge.

**Escalation:** If you cannot restore shape/alignment, stop and send out.
