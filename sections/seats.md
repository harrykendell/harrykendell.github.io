# Seats, wheels, and tracks

## Routine cleaning

[!PROCEDURE:Beginner]] Track and wheel wipe-down
Quick post-outing wipe of tracks and wheels to remove grit and prevent noise.

**Tools:** Damp cloth, microfibre

**Steps:**

1. Wipe tracks end-to-end to remove grit.
2. Wipe wheel treads; remove any embedded debris.
3. Roll the seat end-to-end and listen/feel for new roughness.

**Check:** Seat rolls smoothly end-to-end. Do after every outing.

## Inspection and service

[!PROCEDURE:Intermediate]] Seat inspection (remove + check)
Weekly inspection of wheel condition and track integrity by removing the seat and spinning wheels by hand.

**Tools:** Allen keys/spanners for axle hardware

**Steps:**

1. Remove the seat and place it on a clean bench.
2. Spin each wheel: it should run freely with no grinding, wobble, or tight spots.
3. Check each wheel for flat spots, cracks, and loose bearings/axles.
4. Inspect tracks for dents, burrs, and loose end-stops.

**Check:** No wheel grinding, flats, or wobble; tracks are clean and end-stops secure. Do weekly or if a seat feels rough.
[!/PROCEDURE]

[!PROCEDURE:Intermediate]] Replace seat wheels (as a set)
Annual or wear-based replacement of seat wheels to maintain smooth rolling. Replace all wheels in a seat together to avoid mismatched diameters and uneven tracking.

**Tools:** Replacement wheels, correct fasteners/spacers

**Steps:**

1. Remove the seat.
2. Replace all wheels in that seat assembly (do not mix worn and new wheels).
3. Reuse the correct spacers/washer stack; tighten axles so wheels spin freely without side play.
4. Reinstall the seat and test under load.

**Check:** Smooth travel with no wobble or binding. Replace annually or when wheels show flats/grinding.
[!/PROCEDURE]

[!PROCEDURE:Intermediate]] Track alignment check
Monthly check that seat tracks are straight and parallel to catch misalignment before it causes binding or uneven wear.

**Tools:** Straight edge or taut string line, tape measure, marker

**Steps:**

1. Clean the tracks so you are measuring metal-to-metal, not grit.
2. Check track straightness with a straight edge (or a taut string line) along each track; mark any obvious bows.
3. Measure track spacing at front, middle, and rear; compare values to confirm the tracks are parallel.
4. If adjustment is needed: loosen fasteners just enough to re-set alignment, then re-tighten evenly (avoid over-tightening and stripping inserts).
5. Re-test by rolling the seat end-to-end; confirm no tight spots.

**Check:** Seat rolls freely end-to-end; track spacing consistent along the length. Do monthly, after transport, and if seats bind.
[!/PROCEDURE]

[!PROCEDURE:Intermediate]] Fix loose/spinning track fasteners
Immediately address any track fasteners that are loose or spinning to prevent track movement relative to the hull. Tighten only to the point the track is secure; over-tightening strips inserts and can crush laminate. If an insert is spinning or pulled through, stop and escalate (often requires bonded insert repair).

**Tools:** Correct fasteners, suitable threadlocker or nyloc, washer stack per manufacturer, insert repair kit if required

**Steps:**

1. Remove the suspect fastener and inspect: is the insert sound, spinning, or pulled through?
2. If the insert is sound: clean threads, reassemble with the correct washer stack, and use the appropriate locking method (nyloc or threadlocker).
3. Tighten until the track is secure, then stop (do not “chase torque” if the insert starts to give).
4. If the insert spins or is pulled: tag out the boat and escalate for insert repair.

**Check:** Fasteners hold; no movement of track relative to hull. Do immediately when any loose track fastener is found.

## Noise troubleshooting

Common causes:

- **Grit on tracks/wheels:** clean thoroughly.
- **Flat-spotted wheels:** replace wheels (as a set).
- **Loose track fasteners:** secure with correct washer stack; do not strip inserts.
- **Misaligned tracks:** re-align and re-tighten evenly.

>
> - Track mounts/inserts pulling out or spinning.
> - Seat undercarriage cracked or wheel axle sheared.
