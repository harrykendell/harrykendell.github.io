# Seats, wheels, and tracks

## Routine cleaning

**Procedure: Track and wheel wipe-down**

- **Skill level:** Beginner
- **When to do it:** After every outing
- **Tools & materials:** damp cloth, microfibre
- **Steps:**
  1. Wipe tracks to remove grit.
  2. Wipe wheel tread surfaces.
  3. Check for obvious flat spots.
- **Checks:** seat rolls smoothly end-to-end

## Inspection and service

**Procedure: Seat inspection (remove + check)**

- **Skill level:** Intermediate
- **When to do it:** Weekly/biweekly
- **Tools & materials:** Allen keys/spanners for axle hardware
- **Steps:**
  1. Remove seat; place on clean bench.
  2. Spin each wheel: should run freely with no grinding.
  3. Check for flat spots, wobble, cracks.
  4. Inspect track fasteners and alignment.
  5. Reinstall and confirm smooth travel.
- **Checks:** no bumping; no lateral binding

**Procedure: Replace seat wheels (as a set)**

- **Skill level:** Intermediate
- **When to do it:** Annual or when wheels show wear
- **Tools & materials:** replacement wheels, correct fasteners
- **Steps:**
  1. Remove seat.
  2. Replace all wheels in that seat assembly (avoid mixing worn/new).
  3. Use correct spacers; tighten axles so wheels spin freely.
  4. Reinstall and test.
- **Checks:** smooth travel; no wobble

### Track alignment and fasteners

Seat problems are often track problems.

**Procedure: Track alignment check**

- **Skill level:** Intermediate
- **When to do it:** Monthly; after transport; if seats bind or run “tight” in one direction
- **Tools & materials:** straight edge or taut string line, tape measure, marker
- **Steps:**
  1. Clean tracks thoroughly first (grit can mimic misalignment).
  2. Check each track is straight (no kinks) and firmly fixed along its length.
  3. Measure track spacing at the front/middle/back: values should match within a small tolerance (aim for consistency rather than a specific number).
  4. If misaligned: loosen fasteners slightly, re-set spacing, then re-tighten evenly.
  5. Confirm end-stops are fitted and secure (prevents seat leaving tracks).
- **Checks:** seats roll freely end-to-end; no binding; end-stops present

**Procedure: Fix loose/spinning track fasteners**

- **Skill level:** Intermediate → Professional (depends on insert type)
- **When to do it:** Immediately on any loose track screw/bolt
- **Tools & materials:** correct fasteners, suitable threadlocker, washer stack per manufacturer; insert repair kit if required
- **Steps:**
  1. Do **not** over-tighten: you will strip inserts and crush laminate.
  2. Remove fastener and inspect: is the insert spinning, pulled through, or just loose?
  3. If insert is sound: clean threads and reassemble with appropriate locking method (nyloc or threadlocker).
  4. If insert spins or is pulled: stop and escalate (often requires bonded insert repair).
- **Checks:** fasteners hold torque; no movement of track relative to hull


## Noise troubleshooting

Common causes:

- **Grit on tracks/wheels:** clean thoroughly.
- **Flat-spotted wheels:** replace.
- **Loose track fasteners:** tighten (do not strip inserts).
- **Misaligned tracks:** re-align and re-tighten.

> - Seat undercarriage cracked or wheel axle sheared.
