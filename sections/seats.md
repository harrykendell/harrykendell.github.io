## Routine cleaning

> [!PROCEDURE]
> [!TITLE]
> Track and wheel wipe-down
> [!SKILL]
> Beginner
> [!WARNINGS]
> None
> [!TOOLS]
> Damp cloth, microfibre
> [!DESCRIPTION]
> Quick post-outing wipe of tracks and wheels to remove grit and prevent noise.
> [!STEPS]
>
> 1. Wipe tracks to remove grit.
> 2. Wipe wheel tread surfaces.
> 3. Check for obvious flat spots.
> **Notes:** Seat rolls smoothly end-to-end. Do after every outing.

## Inspection and service

> [!PROCEDURE]
> [!TITLE]
> Seat inspection (remove + check)
> [!SKILL]
> Intermediate
> [!WARNINGS]
> None
> [!TOOLS]
> Allen keys/spanners for axle hardware
> [!DESCRIPTION]
> Weekly inspection of wheel condition and track integrity by removing the seat and spinning wheels by hand.
> [!STEPS]
>
> 1. Remove seat; place on clean bench.
> 2. Spin each wheel: should run freely with no grinding.
> 3. Check for flat spots, wobble, cracks.
> [!TITLE]
> Replace seat wheels (as a set)
> [!SKILL]
> Intermediate
> [!WARNINGS]
> Avoid mixing worn and new wheels
> [!TOOLS]
> Replacement wheels, correct fasteners
> [!DESCRIPTION]
> Annual or wear-based replacement of seat wheels to maintain smooth rolling. Replace all wheels in a seat together.
> [!STEPS] Replace seat wheels (as a set)
> **Skill level:** Intermediate
> **Warnings:** Avoid mixing worn and new wheels
> **Required tools/materials:** Replacement wheels, correct fasteners
> **Description:** Annual or wear-based replacement of seat wheels to maintain smooth rolling. Replace all wheels in a seat together.
> **Steps:**
>
> 1. Remove seat.
> 2. Replace all wheels in that seat assembly (avoid mixing worn/new).
> 3. Use correct spacers; tighten axles so wheels spin freely.
> 4. Reinstall and test.
> **Notes:** Smooth travel; no wobble. Do annual or when wheels show wear.

##[!TITLE]
> Track alignment check
> [!SKILL]
> Intermediate
> [!WARNINGS]
> Do not over-tighten: you will strip inserts and crush laminate
> [!TOOLS]
> Straight edge or taut string line, tape measure, marker
> [!DESCRIPTION]
> Monthly check that seat tracks are straight and parallel to catch misalignment before it causes binding or uneven wear.
> [!STEPS] Track alignment check
> **Skill level:** Intermediate
> **Warnings:** Do not over-tighten: you will strip inserts and crush laminate
> **Required tools/materials:** Straight edge or taut string line, tape measure, marker
> **Description:** Monthly check that seat tracks are straight and parallel to catch misalignment before it causes binding or uneven wear.
> [!TITLE]
> Fix loose/spinning track fasteners
> [!SKILL]
> Intermediate
> [!WARNINGS]
> Do not over-tighten: you will strip inserts and crush laminate; if insert spins or is pulled = stop and escalate (often requires bonded insert repair)
> [!TOOLS]
> Correct fasteners, suitable threadlocker, washer stack per manufacturer, insert repair kit if required
> [!DESCRIPTION]
> Immediately address any track fasteners that are loose or spinning to prevent track movement relative to the hull.
> [!STEPS]ligned: loosen fasteners slightly, re-set spacing, then re-tighten evenly.
> 5. Confirm end-stops are fitted and secure (prevents seat leaving tracks).
> **Notes:** Seats roll freely end-to-end; no binding; end-stops present. Do monthly, after transport, and if seats bind or run tight.

> [!PROCEDURE]
> **Title:** Fix loose/spinning track fasteners
> **Skill level:** Intermediate
> **Warnings:** Do not over-tighten: you will strip inserts and crush laminate; if insert spins or is pulled = stop and escalate (often requires bonded insert repair)
> **Required tools/materials:** Correct fasteners, suitable threadlocker, washer stack per manufacturer, insert repair kit if required
> **Description:** Immediately address any track fasteners that are loose or spinning to prevent track movement relative to the hull.
> **Steps:**
>
> 1. Do not over-tighten: you will strip inserts and crush laminate.
> 2. Remove fastener and inspect: is the insert spinning, pulled through, or just loose?
> 3. If insert is sound: clean threads and reassemble with appropriate locking method (nyloc or threadlocker).
> 4. If insert spins or is pulled: stop and escalate (often requires bonded insert repair).
> **Notes:** Fasteners hold torque; no movement of track relative to hull. Do immediately when any loose track fastener is found.


## Noise troubleshooting

Common causes:

- **Grit on tracks/wheels:** clean thoroughly.
- **Flat-spotted wheels:** replace.
- **Loose track fasteners:** tighten (do not strip inserts).
- **Misaligned tracks:** re-align and re-tighten.

> [!WARNING] Stop-use criteria (seats/tracks)
>
> - Track mount/inserts pulling out.
> - Seat undercarriage cracked or wheel axle sheared.
