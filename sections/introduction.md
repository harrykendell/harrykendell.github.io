# Racing Rowing Boat Maintenance and Repair Manual

> **Scope:** Racing shells and equipment across all boat classes. Procedures apply to carbon fiber / fiberglass / aramid (Kevlar) composite construction unless noted.
>
> **Skill levels:**
>
> - **Beginner:** Safe routine tasks any rower can do.
> - **Intermediate:** Requires basic mechanical competence and correct reassembly.
> - **Professional:** Composite/electrical work where mistakes can cause structural or safety failures.
>
> **Document status:** Single-file manual intended to be split into component chapters later.

## Safety-critical checks (non-negotiable)

This manual assumes you follow the relevant governing-body safety requirements (and any club policy). At minimum, every outing should confirm:

- **Bow ball** present, secure, and in good condition (where required).
- **Buoyancy**: compartments/hatches/bungs sealed and watertight; buoyancy bags fitted if no sealed compartments.
- **Heel restraints and foot release**: heel straps intact and correctly adjusted (typical requirement: heel cannot rise more than **7 cm** from the footplate); foot release must be self-acting.
- **Rudder/fin** secure and steering functional (where fitted).
- **Gates/pins** latch securely; no loose pins.
- **Structure**: no cracks/soft spots around riggers/pins/fin box; no fittings moving relative to the hull.

### How to use this manual

**Audience:** rowers, coxes, coaches, equipment officers, boatman.

**What this covers:** day-to-day checks through professional-level repair workflows.

**What this does not cover (by default):** major structural rebuilds requiring ovens/spray booths, and any procedure that violates manufacturer warranty or local safety policy.

#### Procedure format (use throughout)

Each procedure in this manual follows this format:

- **Skill level** (Beginner / Intermediate / Professional)
- **When to do it** (after every outing / weekly / monthly / annual / after impact)
- **Tools & materials**
- **Parts** (and acceptable substitutions)
- **Safety** (PPE, ventilation, dust, solvents)
- **Steps**
- **Checks** (acceptance tests, measurements)
- **Common failure modes**
- **Escalation** (when to stop and send to a professional)

#### Skill levels (practical meaning)

- **Beginner:** you can follow a checklist and avoid damaging the boat. If you can rig a boat and carry it safely, you can do these tasks.
- **Intermediate:** you can disassemble and reassemble parts correctly, keep track of washers/spacers, and use hand tools without stripping/over-tightening.
- **Professional:** you understand composites and/or electrical connectors; you can create repairs that restore structure and are safe to race.

### Safety

#### PPE by task

- **Cleaning:** gloves if using cleaners; eye protection for splashes.
- **Mechanical work:** eye protection; gloves; cut protection for wire/metal (steering cable ends); avoid loose clothing near rotating tools.
- **Composites:** P2/P3 respirator (dust); goggles; nitrile gloves; long sleeves (carbon/aramid splinters).
- **Solvents/paints:** ventilation; solvent-rated gloves; correct respirator cartridges where required.

#### Composite-specific hazards

- **Sanding dust:** carbon/epoxy dust is a respiratory irritant; aramid/kevlar fuzz is particularly unpleasant. Wet-sand where possible; vacuum with HEPA.
- **Splinters:** carbon and aramid fibres can embed in skin. Use gloves; wash exposed skin; avoid rubbing eyes.
- **Epoxy exotherm:** large mixed volumes can overheat. Mix in shallow trays; follow manufacturer pot-life guidance.
- **Heat tools:** heat guns can scorch paint or soften resin if overused.

#### Lifting and handling

- Use the correct number of people for the boat class.
- Lift at approved carry points (avoid lifting by riggers unless designed for it).
- Use slings and trestles correctly; confirm stability before leaving the boat unattended.
- Trailer loading: protect fin/rudder; avoid over-tightening straps that crush decks.

#### Electrical in wet environments

- Do not energise wet connectors.
- Dry and clean corroded pins before use.
- Test wiring with a multimeter before assuming a device is faulty.

### Quick-reference checklists

#### After every outing (Beginner)

- Rinse boat (especially after saltwater) and wash inside/out with mild soap.
- Wipe dry (microfibre) and open hatches briefly to ventilate; close after dry.
- Wipe seat tracks and seat wheels; remove grit.
- Visual check: fin/rudder, hull, riggers, footplate.
- Gate check: top nuts tight; gates close fully.
- Log/report any impact damage.

#### Weekly / maintenance day (Intermediate)

- Remove seats; clean wheels and tracks; inspect for flat spots.
- Disassemble and clean gates (oarlocks); check bushings/washers.
- Inspect and retighten critical fasteners (rigger bolts, pin fasteners, stretcher fasteners).
- Inspect steering cables, toe hinge bolt/nut, rudder yoke.
- Check for cracks in seats, riggers, footplates.

#### Monthly (Intermediate)

- Audit spares and consumables; restock regatta box.
- Inspect wiring connectors for corrosion; clean and re-seal as needed.
- Inspect hull for developing soft spots/delamination (tap test on suspect areas).

#### Annual / end-of-season (Intermediate/Professional)

- Replace seat wheels as a set (where applicable).
- Full rigging audit (pins, top nuts, washer stacks, footplates).
- Machine polish/wax (if part of the fleet finish policy).
- Service steering cables; replace if frayed.
- Review damage logs; schedule professional repairs.

#### Pre-race (Beginner/Intermediate)

- Gate closure test (each side); confirm no play/rattle.
- Steering centred (if applicable); rudder secure.
- Fin secure and straight.
- Footplates secure; heel restraints compliant.
- Spares in launch: gate nut tool, spare top nuts/washers, tape, multi-tool.
