      Nearly all new blades are Skinnies, with older ones generally being Ultralight or Low&nbsp;I,
      and a range of blade shapes. Ideally we standardise over time to allow mixing and matching sets.
      The biggest factors in maintaining blades are cleaning handles and using vortex tips to prevent
      scraping spoons.
    </p>

    <p>
      The main maintenance tasks are replacing handles (including dealing with end caps popping out)
      and dealing with spoon deterioration. Major damage is usually handled by Concept2 at a major
      regatta; this should be arranged in advance where possible.

    <p>
      Replacing handles is relatively easy for modern C2 ones, although we have some older handles
      that are directly epoxied on. Suede grips are epoxied on; the suede should be removed, not the
      entire handle.

          There are two incompatible types of handle. Old Ultralights use the
          <a href="https://www.concept2.co.uk/product/168" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">larger handle</a>,
          while new oars or Skinnies / sculls need the

      Suede squares need to be fitted so that the seam does not cause blisters, and should be the
      correct size for

      They can be removed with a heat gun and patience; clean the surface with IPA before installing
      replacements. Replacement patches are self-adhesive.

      Green grips must be unscrewed and fully replaced. If the end cap of the oar comes off with the grip,
      epoxy it back in place with Araldite, taking care with rotational alignment.

      Fixed-handle blades and inner green grips can be replaced similarly: remove the old grip, clean,
      and epoxy the new one in place.

      Sleeves are epoxied on and must be oriented correctly to set blade pitch. Concept2 provide a pitch jig,
      but you can also use a flat reference surface. In practice, the back face of the blade should
      align with the P/S marking (port/starboard). Ensure the sleeve is positioned at the correct distance
      from the spoon for the desired gearing.
