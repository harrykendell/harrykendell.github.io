<!-- # Hardware

We typically use a wide variety of hardware, most of which we can buy from a generic supplier. [Westfield Fasteners] is our current go-to. For rowing-specific parts there are several useful sites: [Neaves], [Swift], [Oarsport], and [Eurow].

> [!INFO] Use Marine-Appropriate Stainless
> Hardware should be at least A2 stainless. A4 is best for marine environments, but A2 can work.

Washers should always be used on bolts to help spread the load and protect the boat. Washers should sit closest to the boat. We then use a split washer to lock against vibration. The only time a washer is not needed is when there is an in-built washer or a flanged bolt. When tightening bolts onto split washers don't crush the split washer or it loses its locking ability.

> [!WARNING] Split Washers Will Damage The Hull
> Never put a split washer directly on a boat. Always use a flat washer for it to dig into:  
> `Bolt → Flat → Surface → Flat → Split → Nut`

## Hardware audit and reassembly

**Procedure: Hardware audit (riggers + critical fittings)**

- **Skill level:** Intermediate
- **When to do it:** Monthly, and after transport
- **Tools & materials:** spanners/Allen keys, spare washers/nuts, marker, bags for hardware
- **Safety:** avoid over-tightening and crushing hull
- **Steps:**
  1. Pick a boat and work systematically: bow to stern.
  2. For each critical fastener (rigger bolts, pins, stretcher mounts):
     - check tightness;
     - check correct washer stack;
     - replace any corroded or stripped nuts (nyloc that spins freely is done).
  3. If disassembling: bag and label washers/spacers per location.
  4. Reassemble using the standard washer rule.
- **Checks:** no missing washers; no loose fittings; riggers not rocking
- **Common failure modes:** mixing washer stacks between sides; crushing split washers flat
- **Escalation:** spinning insert/stripped thread → stop and escalate

**Procedure: Freeing a seized stainless fastener (basic)**

- **Skill level:** Intermediate
- **When to do it:** When a nut/bolt will not turn
- **Tools & materials:** penetrating oil, correct sockets/spanners, heat (optional), replacement hardware
- **Safety:** do not apply heat near composite without understanding risk
- **Steps:**
  1. Clean exposed threads. Apply penetrating oil. Wait.
  2. Use correctly sized tools; avoid rounding.
  3. Try tightening slightly then loosening.
  4. If still stuck: consider controlled heat on the nut only (last resort).
  5. Replace hardware after removal.
- **Checks:** threads intact; mating surfaces undamaged
- **Escalation:** if applying force risks ripping an insert from the hull → stop and escalate

> [!WARNING] Stop-use criteria (hardware)
>
> - Any rigger/pin attachment that moves relative to the hull.
> - Any cracked/bent rigger, pin, or pin mount.
> - Any stripped/loose fastener on steering or footplate safety components.

> [!PROCEDURE]
> **Title:** Example Maintenance Task
> **Skill level:** Advanced
> **Description:** This procedure demonstrates the proper format for documenting maintenance tasks in a clear, structured way.
> **Warnings:** Sharp edges on metal parts; avoid over-tightening to prevent hull damage
> **Required tools/materials:** Adjustable wrench, Allen keys (3mm, 5mm), WD-40, clean cloth
> **Steps:**
>
> 1. Gather all required tools and materials before beginning work.
> 2. Inspect the area to be worked on for any existing damage or issues.
> 3. Apply WD-40 to any stuck fasteners and wait 5 minutes.
> 4. Use the correct size tool to loosen fasteners, working systematically.
> 5. Clean and inspect all parts before reassembly.
> **Notes:** Always check torque specifications in the manufacturer's manual when available. Store removed hardware in labeled bags to prevent loss.
