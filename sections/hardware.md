<!-- # Hardware

We typically use a wide variety of hardware, most of which we can buy from a generic supplier. [Westfield Fasteners] is our current go-to. For rowing-specific parts there are several useful sites: [Neaves], [Swift], [Oarsport], and [Eurow].

> [!INFO] Use Marine-Appropriate Stainless
> Hardware should be at least A2 stainless. A4 is best for marine environments, but A2 can work.

Washers should always be used on bolts to help spread the load and protect the boat. Washers should sit closest to the boat. We then use a split washer to lock against vibration. The only time a washer is not needed is when there is an in-built washer or a flanged bolt. When tightening bolts onto split washers don't crush the split washer or it loses its locking ability.

> [!WARNING] Split Washers Will Damage The Hull
> Never put a split washer directly on a boat. Always use a flat washer for it to dig into:  
> `Bolt → Flat → Surface → Flat → Split → Nut`

# Hardware

We buy generic hardware from [Westfield Fasteners](https://www.westfieldfasteners.co.uk/). Rowing-specific parts are typically from:

- [Neaves](https://neaves-rowing.com/)
- [Swift](https://rowingcentre.co.uk/shop/overview)
- [Oarsport](https://oarsport.co.uk/)
- [Eurow](https://www.eurow.eu/en/parts-rowing-boats.html)

> [!INFO] Use marine-appropriate stainless (and avoid galvanic surprises)
> - **A2** stainless is roughly **304** grade; **A4** is roughly **316** grade (better chloride resistance).
> - Prefer **A4/316** for any hardware that regularly gets wet (especially salt/brackish).
> - Where stainless mates to aluminium (riggers, backstays), use isolating washers and a corrosion inhibitor to reduce galvanic corrosion.

> [!WARNING] Split washers: never against composite
> Split/spring washers can **crush paint**, **bruise laminate**, and create stress concentrations.
>
> - Never put a split washer directly on a boat surface.
> - Use **flat washers** against composite: they spread load and protect paint.
> - If you need locking: prefer **nyloc nuts**, **threadlocker**, or manufacturer-specified locking features.
>
> Typical safe stack:
> `Bolt head → Flat washer → Hull/Rigger → Flat washer → (Split/spring washer if used) → Nut`
>
> Exceptions (still require flat washers against composite):
> - Bolts with **integral flanges** can substitute for the bolt-head washer (only if the flange is broad and smooth).

## Hardware audit and reassembly

> [!PROCEDURE]
> **Title:** Hardware audit (riggers + critical fittings)
> **Skill level:** Intermediate
> **Warnings:** Spinning insert/stripped thread = stop and escalate. Avoid over-tightening and crushing hull
> **Required tools/materials:** Spanners/Allen keys, spare washers/nuts, marker, bags for hardware
> **Description:** Monthly systematic check of all rigger bolts, pins, and stretcher mounts to catch corrosion, missing washers, and loose fasteners before they cause damage.
> **Steps:**
>
> 1. Pick a boat and work systematically: bow to stern.
> 2. For each critical fastener (rigger bolts, pins, stretcher mounts):
>    - Check tightness.
>    - Check correct washer stack.
>    - Replace any corroded or stripped nuts (nyloc that spins freely is done).
> 3. If disassembling: bag and label washers/spacers per location.
> 4. Reassemble using the standard washer rule.
> **Notes:** No missing washers; no loose fittings; riggers not rocking. Watch for mixed washer stacks and crushing split washers. Do monthly and after transport.

> [!PROCEDURE]
> **Title:** Freeing a seized stainless fastener (basic)
> **Skill level:** Intermediate
> **Warnings:** Do not apply heat near composite without understanding risk; if applying force risks ripping an insert from the hull = stop and escalate
> **Required tools/materials:** Penetrating oil, correct sockets/spanners, heat (optional), replacement hardware
> **Description:** Free a stuck stainless bolt or nut caused by corrosion or galling so it can be removed and replaced.
> **Steps:**
>
> 1. Clean exposed threads. Apply penetrating oil. Wait.
> 2. Use correctly sized tools; avoid rounding.
> 3. Try tightening slightly then loosening.
> 4. If still stuck: consider controlled heat on the nut only (last resort).
> 5. Replace hardware after removal.
> **Notes:** Threads intact; mating surfaces undamaged. Do when a nut/bolt will not turn.

## Preventing galling and seizure (stainless hardware)

Stainless-on-stainless threads can **gall** (cold-weld) without warning, especially when dry or over-tightened.

- Use a **small amount of anti-seize** (or suitable grease) on stainless threads that are frequently removed.
- Avoid high-speed tightening with power tools; hand-tighten and stop when “snug”.
- Replace **nyloc nuts** when the nylon ring no longer provides friction.
- If a fastener starts to feel “gritty” or binds early, stop and replace it (don’t force it).

Where you must keep threads clean (e.g., bonding inserts nearby), keep lubricant off the composite and wipe excess immediately.


> [!WARNING] Stop-use criteria (hardware)
>
> - Any rigger/pin attachment that moves relative to the hull.
> - Any cracked/bent rigger, pin, or pin mount.
> - Any stripped/loose fastener on steering or footplate safety components.
