The gate consists of the pin, top nut, pitch bushings, and washers. Ensure washers are arranged so that load is spread, the gate closes cleanly, and pitch remains as set by the manufacturer or by your rigging measurements. -->

The gate assembly consists of the **pin**, **oarlock/gate**, **pitch bushings**, **washers/spacers**, and a **top nut/retainer**.

## Daily checks

> [!PROCEDURE]
> **Title:** Gate safety check
> **Skill level:** Beginner
> **Warnings:** Latch failure, cracked gate, or loose pin = stop-use
> **Required tools/materials:** None (or gate nut tool if something is loose)
> **Description:** Daily pre-outing check that the gate latch is secure and the gate cannot pop out under load.
> **Steps:**
>
> 1. Close each gate and confirm latch fully engages.
> 2. Lift the oar handle firmly to confirm the oar cannot pop out.
> 3. Wiggle gate vertically: there should be minimal play (no rattle).
> 4. Confirm top nut/retainer is tight.
> **Notes:** Secure closure; no rattle. Do this before every outing.

## Clean and rebuild

> [!PROCEDURE]
> **Title:** Disassemble, clean, rebuild gate stack
> **Skill level:** Intermediate
> **Warnings:** Do not oil plastic parts (attracts grit); watch for missing washer (causes rattle and accelerated wear) and swapped bushings (changes pitch); bent pin, stripped threads, cracked gate body = replace parts/escalate
> **Required tools/materials:** Spanners, mild degreaser, brush, spare washers/bushings, lint-free cloth
> **Description:** Maintenance day procedure to disassemble, clean, and reassemble gate hardware to eliminate salt corrosion and squeaking.
> **Steps:**
>
> 1. Remove top nut/retainer and lift off gate.
> 2. Keep washer stacks grouped (bottom vs top). Photograph if needed.
> 3. Clean pin and all washers. Inspect for corrosion.
> 4. Inspect pitch bushings for cracks/ovalisation; replace if worn.
> 5. Reassemble: washers arranged to eliminate vertical play while allowing free rotation.
> 6. Tighten top nut and re-check closure.
> **Notes:** Free rotation; no rattle; pitch unchanged. Do on maintenance day or after saltwater regatta.

## Pitch and height adjustments

> [!PROCEDURE]
> **Title:** Adjust gate height (washer stack)
> **Skill level:** Intermediate
> **Warnings:** None
> **Required tools/materials:** Gate washers/shims, calipers/ruler, rigging sheet
> **Description:** When rigging changes or mismatched heights are observed, adjust the washer stack to achieve correct gate height.
> **Steps:**
>
> 1. Measure current height (club method). Record.
> 2. Add/remove washers **symmetrically** to achieve target.
> 3. Ensure gate still closes and rotates freely.
> 4. Record final washer stack (count + thickness).
> **Notes:** Measured height matches target; no play.

> [!PROCEDURE]
> **Title:** Set/verify pitch
> **Skill level:** Intermediate
> **Warnings:** If you cannot match pitch across sides, replace pin/gate components
> **Required tools/materials:** Pitch gauge, correct pitch bushings, rigging sheet
> **Description:** After bushing replacement or suspected pitch drift, verify that both sides have correct and matching pitch.
> **Steps:**
>
> 1. Verify bushing pair angle markings.
> 2. Install bushings correctly oriented.
> 3. Measure pitch with gauge and confirm both sides match.
> 4. Record bushing type/angle.
> **Notes:** No pitch drift; both sides match.

> [!WARNING] Stop-use criteria (gates)
>
> - Gate latch does not fully close or opens under load.
> - Cracked gate body, missing retainer, or bent pin.
> - Severe rattle you cannot eliminate with correct washer stack.
