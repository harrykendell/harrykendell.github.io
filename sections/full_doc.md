### How to use this manual

**Audience:** rowers, coxes, coaches, equipment officers, boatman.

**What this covers:** day-to-day checks through professional-level repair workflows.

**What this does not cover (by default):** major structural rebuilds requiring ovens/spray booths, and any procedure that violates manufacturer warranty or local safety policy.

#### Procedure format (use throughout)

Each procedure in this manual follows this format:

- **Skill level** (Beginner / Intermediate / Professional)
- **When to do it** (after every outing / weekly / monthly / annual / after impact)
- **Tools & materials**
- **Parts** (and acceptable substitutions)
- **Safety** (PPE, ventilation, dust, solvents)
- **Steps**
- **Checks** (acceptance tests, measurements)
- **Common failure modes**
- **Escalation** (when to stop and send to a professional)

#### Skill levels (practical meaning)

- **Beginner:** you can follow a checklist and avoid damaging the boat. If you can rig a boat and carry it safely, you can do these tasks.
- **Intermediate:** you can disassemble and reassemble parts correctly, keep track of washers/spacers, and use hand tools without stripping/over-tightening.
- **Professional:** you understand composites and/or electrical connectors; you can create repairs that restore structure and are safe to race.

### Safety

#### PPE by task

- **Cleaning:** gloves if using cleaners; eye protection for splashes.
- **Mechanical work:** eye protection; gloves; cut protection for wire/metal (steering cable ends); avoid loose clothing near rotating tools.
- **Composites:** P2/P3 respirator (dust); goggles; nitrile gloves; long sleeves (carbon/aramid splinters).
- **Solvents/paints:** ventilation; solvent-rated gloves; correct respirator cartridges where required.

#### Composite-specific hazards

- **Sanding dust:** carbon/epoxy dust is a respiratory irritant; aramid/kevlar fuzz is particularly unpleasant. Wet-sand where possible; vacuum with HEPA.
- **Splinters:** carbon and aramid fibres can embed in skin. Use gloves; wash exposed skin; avoid rubbing eyes.
- **Epoxy exotherm:** large mixed volumes can overheat. Mix in shallow trays; follow manufacturer pot-life guidance.
- **Heat tools:** heat guns can scorch paint or soften resin if overused.

#### Lifting and handling

- Use the correct number of people for the boat class.
- Lift at approved carry points (avoid lifting by riggers unless designed for it).
- Use slings and trestles correctly; confirm stability before leaving the boat unattended.
- Trailer loading: protect fin/rudder; avoid over-tightening straps that crush decks.

#### Electrical in wet environments

- Do not energise wet connectors.
- Dry and clean corroded pins before use.
- Test wiring with a multimeter before assuming a device is faulty.

## Part I — The boat (shell) and its systems

### 7. Boats

#### 7.1 Routine care & cleaning

**Procedure: Post-outing wash-down**

- **Skill level:** Beginner
- **When to do it:** After every outing (mandatory)
- **Tools & materials:** hose, bucket, mild soap, soft brush, microfibre cloths
- **Parts:** none
- **Safety:** avoid pressure-washing near seams, decals, or hatch seals
- **Steps:**
  1. Rinse hull, riggers, and runners/tracks with fresh water.
  2. Wash with mild soap (inside and outside), then rinse thoroughly.
  3. Wipe dry with microfibre cloth (especially runners and inside cockpit).
  4. Open bow/stern hatches briefly to ventilate. Close once dry.
  5. Quick visual check: fin/rudder, obvious scratches, loose hardware.
- **Checks:** no standing water; tracks feel smooth; no new obvious cracks
- **Common failure modes:** leaving salt = corrosion; leaving water = mould and seized hardware
- **Escalation:** if you see cracks, soft spots, or impact damage, report and tag the boat

**Procedure: Maintenance day deep-clean**

- **Skill level:** Intermediate
- **When to do it:** Weekly/biweekly (fleet dependent)
- **Tools & materials:** standard tool kit, brushes, microfibres, vinegar (dilute), hull cleaner (optional)
- **Parts:** replacement washers, nyloc nuts as needed
- **Safety:** gloves/eye protection for cleaners
- **Steps:**
  1. Remove seats and clean wheels/tracks.
  2. Remove selected hardware (rigger bolts, key fasteners) and check for missing washers.
  3. Inspect for cracks in seats, riggers, footplates.
  4. Remove limescale with diluted vinegar; rinse thoroughly.
  5. If using a hull cleaner (e.g., Starbrite): apply briefly, scrub lightly, rinse thoroughly.
- **Checks:** no missing washers; all critical bolts tightened; steering functional
- **Common failure modes:** reassembly mistakes (washer order); over-cleaning with aggressive chemicals
- **Escalation:** stripped inserts, seized bolts, or any structural cracking → escalate to equipment officer

**Procedure: Periodic polish**

- **Skill level:** Intermediate
- **When to do it:** As needed (typically end-of-season)
- **Tools & materials:** fine-cut compound, foam pad, low-RPM polisher, microfibres, wax (if used)
- **Safety:** eye protection; keep cables clear of water; do not overheat paint
- **Steps:**
  1. Wash and dry the hull completely.
  2. Machine polish at low RPM, keeping the pad moving.
  3. Wipe residue and inspect. Repeat lightly if needed.
  4. Apply wax/sealant if part of club policy.
- **Checks:** finish restored without burn-through
- **Escalation:** if paint is thin or you see primer/carbon, stop and plan professional repaint

#### 7.2 Storage and transport

**Storage rules (always):**

- Store indoors where possible; avoid long-term UV exposure.
- Support boats on correct slings/trestles at approved points.
- Keep hatches closed during storage (after drying) to prevent pests and humidity cycling.
- Do not store with riggers bearing abnormal loads; avoid leaning shells against hard edges.

**Procedure: Trailer loading and transport**

- **Skill level:** Beginner (with supervision for large boats)
- **When to do it:** Every transport
- **Tools & materials:** straps, padding, fin/rudder protectors, tape
- **Safety:** pinch points; overhead hazards; avoid strap crush on decks
- **Steps:**
  1. Confirm fin/rudder clearance and protection.
  2. Place hull in cradles; ensure contact points are padded.
  3. Strap snugly (no deck crushing). Use bow/stern lines to prevent fore-aft movement.
  4. Secure loose riggers or remove if required.
  5. After 10–15 minutes driving, stop and re-check strap tension.
- **Checks:** no movement; fin/rudder protected
- **Escalation:** if the boat flexes under straps, stop and re-rig the support points

#### 7.3 Inspection and damage triage

> [!WARNING] Stop-use criteria (shell)
> Take the boat **out of service immediately** if any of the following are true:
>
> - Cracks radiating from rigger mounting areas or along structural ribs.
> - Any **soft spot** that is growing, especially on the hull near the waterline or near the fin box.
> - Fin box movement, cracking, or leaking (water ingress).
> - Seat track mounts/inserts moving or pulling out.
> - Delamination you can flex by hand, or that sounds “dead” in a tap test over a large area.
> - Any puncture where core is exposed and has been wet.

**Procedure: Damage triage (cosmetic vs structural)**

- **Skill level:** Intermediate
- **When to do it:** After any impact, or when new damage is observed
- **Tools & materials:** bright light, marker/tape, camera, coin/tap hammer, ruler
- **Safety:** gloves if fibres exposed
- **Steps:**
  1. Clean the area; damage is hard to classify when dirty.
  2. Photograph with a scale (ruler/coin). Mark the boundary with tape.
  3. Tap test outward from the damage: listen for change from “sharp” to “dull”.
  4. Check both sides (inside cockpit and outside hull) if accessible.
  5. Classify:
     - **Cosmetic:** paint/gelcoat scratch with no fibre break, no soft spot.
     - **Minor structural:** shallow fibre damage limited area, no core crush.
     - **Structural:** core crush, delamination, cracks through skin, puncture.
  6. Decide next action: seal-and-monitor / in-house repair / professional repair.
- **Checks:** damage logged; boat tagged appropriately
- **Common failure modes:** underestimating hidden delamination; ignoring water ingress
- **Escalation:** uncertain classification → treat as structural and escalate

#### 7.4 Composite construction primer

Most racing shells are sandwich structures:

- **Outer and inner skins:** carbon and/or aramid (Kevlar) and/or glass fibre in multiple plies.
- **Core:** often Nomex honeycomb.
- **Finish:** 2K automotive-style paint (common in high-end shells) or gelcoat (older/cheaper builds).

Repair implications:

- You can do strong wet layups and vacuum-bagging in-house.
- You generally **cannot** replicate factory 2K paint safely without proper spray/ventilation.
- You typically **cannot** oven-cure a whole boat; cure at ambient and avoid heat damage.

**Repair decision rules (practical):**

- **Seal and monitor (in-house, fast):** hairline paint cracks, superficial scratches, tiny gelcoat chips.
- **In-house structural repair:** localised skin damage, small delamination, small punctures where core can be dried and replaced.
- **Professional repair:** large-area delamination, fin box rebuild, major core crush, long cracks near rigger mounts, any damage that changes hull shape.

#### 7.6 Composite repairs (procedures)

**Procedure: Cosmetic scratch/chip seal**

- **Skill level:** Beginner → Intermediate
- **When to do it:** As soon as practical (prevents water ingress)
- **Tools & materials:** fine sandpaper (400–800), IPA, small brush, epoxy or clearcoat/paint touch-up
- **Parts:** none
- **Safety:** gloves; avoid breathing sanding dust
- **Steps:**
  1. Clean and dry the area.
  2. Lightly sand the damaged paint edge to remove sharp flaking.
  3. Wipe with IPA; allow to dry.
  4. Apply a thin seal coat (epoxy or matching touch-up) over exposed fibre/primer.
  5. Allow to cure; lightly sand and blend if needed.
- **Checks:** no exposed fibre; no sharp edges
- **Escalation:** if fibres are broken or area feels soft → treat as structural

**Procedure: Small delamination stabilisation (inject + clamp)**

- **Skill level:** Intermediate
- **When to do it:** Early, before delam grows
- **Tools & materials:** syringe, low-viscosity epoxy, masking tape, clamps/weights, wax paper/release film
- **Safety:** gloves; keep epoxy off paint where possible
- **Steps:**
  1. Define boundary with tap test; mark with tape.
  2. Drill a tiny injection hole at the edge of delam (only through outer skin).
  3. Warm the area slightly (optional) to reduce viscosity (do not overheat).
  4. Inject epoxy until it wets the delam area (watch for squeeze-out at boundary).
  5. Cover with release film/wax paper and clamp/weight to restore shape.
  6. Cure fully; sand/finish cosmetically.
- **Checks:** tap test sounds uniform; no flex by hand
- **Common failure modes:** not enough epoxy penetration; clamping dents the hull
- **Escalation:** if delam is large or near structural attachments → scarf repair or professional

**Procedure: Scarf repair (structural skin + core)**

- **Skill level:** Professional
- **When to do it:** punctures, core crush, structural cracks
- **Tools & materials:** grinder/sander, vacuum, carbon cloth/tape, core, epoxy, peel ply, perforated film, breather, bag film, tacky tape, vacuum pump, fairing filler, primers/paint
- **Safety:** respirator, goggles, gloves, ventilation
- **Steps:**
  1. **Open up damage:** remove all broken laminate/core to sound material. Round corners.
  2. **Scarf/taper:** bevel skins to a shallow taper (typical 12:1 or longer).
  3. **Dry-fit core:** cut replacement core flush with surrounding; bond in with thickened epoxy.
  4. **Layup:** cut plies to fill scarf (stepped patches); wet out and lay in order.
  5. **Vacuum bag:** peel ply → perf film → breather → bag. Pull vacuum and watch for resin starvation.
  6. **Cure:** allow full cure (do not disturb shape).
  7. **Sand/shape:** bring flush with surrounding.
  8. **Fair:** apply fairing compound; sand smooth.
  9. **Prime/paint:** apply compatible primer and paint (air-dry system). Blend and polish.
- **Checks:** thickness matches surrounding; no hard steps; tap test uniform; finish sealed
- **Common failure modes:** leaving damaged laminate; too-steep scarf; starving laminate under vacuum; creating a stiff “hard patch” edge
- **Escalation:** if you cannot restore shape/alignment, stop and send out

#### 8.2 Hardware audit and reassembly

**Procedure: Hardware audit (riggers + critical fittings)**

- **Skill level:** Intermediate
- **When to do it:** Monthly, and after transport
- **Tools & materials:** spanners/Allen keys, spare washers/nuts, marker, bags for hardware
- **Safety:** avoid over-tightening and crushing hull
- **Steps:**
  1. Pick a boat and work systematically: bow to stern.
  2. For each critical fastener (rigger bolts, pins, stretcher mounts):
     - check tightness;
     - check correct washer stack;
     - replace any corroded or stripped nuts (nyloc that spins freely is done).
  3. If disassembling: bag and label washers/spacers per location.
  4. Reassemble using the standard washer rule.
- **Checks:** no missing washers; no loose fittings; riggers not rocking
- **Common failure modes:** mixing washer stacks between sides; crushing split washers flat
- **Escalation:** spinning insert/stripped thread → stop and escalate

**Procedure: Freeing a seized stainless fastener (basic)**

- **Skill level:** Intermediate
- **When to do it:** When a nut/bolt will not turn
- **Tools & materials:** penetrating oil, correct sockets/spanners, heat (optional), replacement hardware
- **Safety:** do not apply heat near composite without understanding risk
- **Steps:**
  1. Clean exposed threads. Apply penetrating oil. Wait.
  2. Use correctly sized tools; avoid rounding.
  3. Try tightening slightly then loosening.
  4. If still stuck: consider controlled heat on the nut only (last resort).
  5. Replace hardware after removal.
- **Checks:** threads intact; mating surfaces undamaged
- **Escalation:** if applying force risks ripping an insert from the hull → stop and escalate

> [!WARNING] Stop-use criteria (hardware)
>
> - Any rigger/pin attachment that moves relative to the hull.
> - Any cracked/bent rigger, pin, or pin mount.
> - Any stripped/loose fastener on steering or footplate safety components.

## Part IV — Oars and blades

### 12. Oars

Nearly all new blades are Skinnies, with older ones generally being Ultralight or Low I, and a range of blade shapes. Standardising over time improves mix-and-match and reduces spares complexity.

#### 12.1 Handling rules (prevents 80% of damage)

- Never push off a dock with the blade.
- Avoid scraping spoon tips; use protective vortex tips/edge protection if available.
- Store oars on racks with support at approved points; avoid direct sun long-term.
- Rinse after saltwater; wipe grips and sleeves.

> [!WARNING] Stop-use criteria (oars)
>
> - Shaft crack, soft spot, or “crunching” under flex.
> - Blade-to-shaft joint damage.
> - Major delamination that can be flexed by hand.

#### 12.2 Handles

> [!INFO] Handle Types
> There are two incompatible types of handle. Old Ultralights use the [larger handle](https://www.concept2.co.uk/product/168), while new oars or Skinnies/sculls need the [standard handle](https://www.concept2.co.uk/product/62).

**Procedure: Replace suede patch**

- **Skill level:** Intermediate
- **When to do it:** when suede is worn, torn, or lifting
- **Tools & materials:** heat gun, IPA, replacement patches

## Part V — Electronics and wiring

### 13. Coxbox wiring and boat harnesses

<figure class="figure figure--float-right">
  <img src="imgs/coxbox_plug.jpg" alt="Close-up of a coxbox plug showing pin layout" />
  <div class="figure-body">
    <p class="figure-title">Reference photo of a coxbox plug</p>
    <p class="figure-caption">
      Match the pin numbering and keyway orientation shown here when assembling new harnesses or replacing plugs.
    </p>
  </div>
</figure>

The wiring harness is relatively simple, with 5 pins on the main plug. These are split into speakers, rate, and charging pins. Not all pins are used in every connector, so wiring can break out to 2-pin or 4-pin plugs where needed.

#### 13.1 Troubleshooting

Refer to this document for detailed troubleshooting:

- <http://www.redking.me.uk/sport/rowing/equipment/cox_box/nk_repairs.pdf>

**Procedure: Quick electrical diagnosis (multimeter)**

- **Skill level:** Intermediate
- **When to do it:** when rate/speakers/charging do not work
- **Tools & materials:** multimeter, contact cleaner
- **Safety:** do not test wet connectors
- **Steps:**
  1. Dry connector; inspect for corrosion.
  2. **Rate:** A–D should connect to a magnet switch. Manually shorting A–D periodically should show stroke rate.
  3. **Speakers:** C–B should read as a load/short when speakers are wired.
  4. **Charging:** D–E should read ~13.5–15 V from charger (where applicable).
- **Checks:** values consistent; if not, locate break by testing each segment

#### 13.2 Parts and sourcing

Harness components are sold at significant markup by NK Sports, Oarsport, etc. The connectors appear to be based on the [Amphenol 44 series](https://www.amphenol-sine.com/pdf/catalog/44-Series.pdf).
