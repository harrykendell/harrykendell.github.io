<!-- # Footplates

We have several different steering systems across boats.

## Steering wire

They can generally all use the same wire: 2 mm high-grade [PVC-coated stainless rope (7x7)][wire-rope]. Ideally we buy this direct (~£0.44/m) rather than paying about £3/m from a rowing shop.

# Footplates, shoes, and steering

## Footplate adjustment and inspection

**Procedure: Footplate set-up (athlete adjustment)**

- **Skill level:** Beginner
- **When to do it:** Before rowing
- **Tools & materials:** none or wing nuts (depending on system)
- **Steps:**
  1. Set stretcher position to athlete’s number.
  2. Confirm left/right are symmetric (count holes/marks).
  3. Confirm all clamps/nuts are tight.
- **Checks:** no wobble; symmetric placement

## Heel restraints (safety-critical)

> [!WARNING] Heel restraints are safety-critical
> Heel restraints must prevent the heel lifting excessively and must be intact and properly secured. If in doubt, **do not row**.

**Procedure: Heel restraint inspection and replacement**

- **Skill level:** Beginner → Intermediate
- **When to do it:** Before every outing; replace immediately if worn
- **Tools & materials:** suitable cord/strap, scissors, lighter/heat to seal ends
- **Steps:**
  1. Inspect both heel ties for fraying, knots, looseness.
  2. Confirm heel lift is limited per club policy.
  3. Replace using durable cord/strap; secure knots and seal ends.
- **Checks:** cannot lift heel beyond limit; both shoes secured

## Steering wire

They can generally all use the same wire: **2 mm high-grade PVC-coated stainless rope (7x7)**.

**Procedure: Steering functional check**

- **Skill level:** Beginner
- **When to do it:** Before outings in steered boats
- **Steps:**
  1. Centre toe steering.
  2. Confirm rudder aligns with fin.
  3. Move toe left/right; confirm smooth rudder travel.
- **Escalation:** binding, slack, or off-centre → maintenance

**Procedure: Replace steering cable**

- **Skill level:** Intermediate → Professional
- **When to do it:** fraying, snapped cable, repeated centring drift
- **Tools & materials:** cable, cutters, clamps/stops, crimping tool (if using ferrules), tape
- **Safety:** cut cable ends are sharp; gloves and eye protection
- **Steps:**
  1. Document routing and attachment points (photos).
  2. Remove old cable; use it to pull new cable through if possible.
  3. Attach at toe mechanism.
  4. Centre rudder and toe; attach at yoke.
  5. Tension evenly and verify full travel.
  6. Secure ends (ferrules/tape/heatshrink).
- **Checks:** rudder centred when toe centred; smooth travel; no snagging
- **Escalation:** if cable routing is inaccessible or tubes are blocked → escalate

> [!WARNING] Stop-use criteria (footplate/steering)
>
> - Broken or missing heel restraint.
> - Steering cable frayed or rudder linkage loose.
> - Footplate mount loose or cracked.
