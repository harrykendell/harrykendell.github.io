# Footplates, shoes, and steering

Different boats use different stretcher and steering systems (wing-nut tracks, quick-release clamps, wire rope, Dyneema, rigid pushrods). Always confirm the exact routing and parts on that boat’s rigging sheet.

## Footplate adjustment and inspection

[!PROCEDURE:Beginner] Footplate set-up (athlete adjustment)
Quick pre-rowing adjustment of stretcher position to the athlete's preferred setting.

**Tools:** None or wing nuts (depending on system)

**Steps:**

1. Set stretcher position to the athlete's number/mark.
2. Confirm left/right are symmetric (count holes/marks).
3. Confirm all clamps/nuts are tight.

**Check:** No wobble; symmetric placement.

## Heel restraints (safety-critical)

> [!WARNING] Heel restraints and foot release are safety-critical
> In any boat with fitted shoes, each shoe must be independently restrained and the **heel must not be able to rise more than 7 cm** (measured at right angles from the footplate). The foot release must be **self-acting** (should not require intervention by athlete or rescuer).
>
> Do not use **laces** or **cable ties** as heel restraints; use durable cord/strap designed for the job.

[!PROCEDURE:Beginner] Heel restraint inspection and replacement
Safety-critical check and replacement of heel ties to ensure foot retention in case of capsize. If any heel restraint is broken or missing, stop-use until corrected.

**Tools:** Suitable cord/strap, scissors, lighter/heat to seal ends

**Steps:**

1. Inspect both heel ties for fraying, knots, looseness, or missing attachments.
2. Measure heel lift: the heel must not rise more than **7 cm** from the footplate.
3. Replace using durable cord/strap; tie securely and seal/finish ends so they cannot fray.
4. Confirm the shoe releases freely without intervention (self-acting).

**Check:** Both shoes restrained; heel lift within limit; release is self-acting. Do before every outing and replace immediately if worn.

## Steering wire

[!PROCEDURE:Beginner] Steering functional check
Quick pre-outing check that steering is centred and moves freely. If steering binds, goes slack, or will not centre, do not launch until fixed.

**Tools:** None

**Steps:**

1. With the boat supported, centre the toe steering and confirm the rudder is centred.
2. Move toes to full travel left/right; confirm smooth, even rudder travel with no snags.
3. Check cable/rope tension throughout travel (no slack loops, no rubbing on sharp edges).

**Check:** Rudder centred at toe-centre; full travel smooth and repeatable. Do before every outing.
[!/PROCEDURE]

[!PROCEDURE:Intermediate] Replace steering cable
Replace a frayed or snapped steering cable to restore full steering responsiveness. Cable ends are sharp when cut; handle with gloves and eye protection and tape ends immediately.

**Tools:** Cable, cutters, clamps/stops, crimping tool (if using ferrules), tape/heatshrink

**Steps:**

1. Photograph routing and attachment points (toe mechanism and rudder yoke).
2. Remove the old cable; if possible, use it to pull the new cable through the same routing.
3. Attach at the toe mechanism first, then centre toe and centre rudder.
4. Attach at the rudder yoke; set equal tension left/right and verify full travel.
5. Secure and finish cable ends (ferrules + tape/heatshrink) so there are no sharp strands.

**Check:** Rudder centred when toe centred; smooth travel; no snagging or slack. Replace when frayed/snapped or if centring repeatedly drifts.
[!/PROCEDURE]

> [!WARNING] Stop-use criteria (footplate/steering)
>
> - Broken or missing heel restraint.
> - Steering cable frayed or rudder linkage loose.
> - Footplate mount loose or cracked.
