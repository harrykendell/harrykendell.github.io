<!-- # Footplates

We have several different steering systems across boats.

## Steering wire

They can generally all use the same wire: 2 mm high-grade [PVC-coated stainless rope (7x7)][wire-rope]. Ideally we buy this direct (~£0.44/m) rather than paying about £3/m from a rowing shop.

# Footplates, shoes, and steering

Different boats use different stretcher and steering systems (wing-nut tracks, quick-release clamps, wire rope, Dyneema, rigid pushrods). Always confirm the exact routing and parts on that boat’s rigging sheet.

## Footplate adjustment and inspection

> [!PROCEDURE]
> [!TITLE]
> Footplate set-up (athlete adjustment)
> [!SKILL]
> Beginner
> [!WARNINGS]
> None
> [!TOOLS]
> None or wing nuts (depending on system)
> [!DESCRIPTION]
> Quick pre-rowing adjustment of stretcher position to the athlete's preferred height.
> [!STEPS]
>
> 1. Set stretcher position to athlete's number.
> 2. Confirm left/right are symmetric (count holes/marks).
> 3. Confirm all clamps/nuts are tight.
> **Notes:** No wobble; symmetric placement.

## Heel restraints (safety-critical)

> [!WARNING] Heel restraints and foot release are safety-critical
> In any boat with fitted shoes, each shoe must be independently restrained and the **heel must not be able to rise more than 7 cm** (measured at right angles from the footplate). The foot release must be **self-acting** (should not require intervention by athlete or rescuer).
>
> Do not use **laces** or **cable ties** as heel restraints; use durable cord/strap designed for the job.

> [!PROCEDURE]
> [!TITLE]
> Heel restraint inspection and replacement
> [!SKILL]
> Beginner
> [!WARNINGS]
> Broken or missing heel restraint = stop-use; never use laces or cable ties as heel restraints; heel must not rise more than 7 cm from footplate
> [!TOOLS]
> Suitable cord/strap, scissors, lighter/heat to seal ends
> [!DESCRIPTION]
> Safety-critical check and replacement of heel ties to ensure foot retention in case of capsize.
> [!STEPS]
>
> 1. Inspect both heel ties for fraying, knots, looseness.
> 2. Measure heel lift: the heel must not rise more than 7 cm from the footplate.
> 3. Replace using durable cord/strap; secure knots and seal ends.
> **Notes:** Cannot lift heel beyond limit; both shoes secured. Do before every outing and replace immediately if worn.

## Steering wire

Th[!TITLE]
> Steering functional check
> [!SKILL]
> Beginner
> [!WARNINGS]
> Binding, slack, or off-centre = maintenance required
> [!TOOLS]
> None
> [!DESCRIPTION]
> Quick pre-outing check that steering is centered and responsive.
> [!STEPS] Steering functional check
> **Skill level:** Beginner
> **Warnings:** Binding, slack, or off-centre = maintenance required
> **Required tools/materials:** None
> **Description:** Quick pre-outing check that steering is centered and responsive.
> **Steps:**
>
> 1. Centre toe steering.
> [!TITLE]
> Replace steering cable
> [!SKILL]
> Intermediate
> [!WARNINGS]
> Cut cable ends are sharp; use gloves and eye protection; if cable routing is inaccessible or tubes are blocked = escalate
> [!TOOLS]
> Cable, cutters, clamps/stops, crimping tool (if using ferrules), tape
> [!DESCRIPTION]
> Replace a frayed or snapped steering cable to restore full steering responsiveness.
> [!STEPS] Replace steering cable
> **Skill level:** Intermediate
> **Warnings:** Cut cable ends are sharp; use gloves and eye protection; if cable routing is inaccessible or tubes are blocked = escalate
> **Required tools/materials:** Cable, cutters, clamps/stops, crimping tool (if using ferrules), tape
> **Description:** Replace a frayed or snapped steering cable to restore full steering responsiveness.
> **Steps:**
>
> 1. Document routing and attachment points (photos).
> 2. Remove old cable; use it to pull new cable through if possible.
> 3. Attach at toe mechanism.
> 4. Centre rudder and toe; attach at yoke.
> 5. Tension evenly and verify full travel.
> 6. Secure ends (ferrules/tape/heatshrink).
> **Notes:** Rudder centred when toe centred; smooth travel; no snagging. Do when fraying, snapped cable, or repeated centring drift is observed.

> [!WARNING] Stop-use criteria (footplate/steering)
>
> - Broken or missing heel restraint.
> - Steering cable frayed or rudder linkage loose.
> - Footplate mount loose or cracked.
