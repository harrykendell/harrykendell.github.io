      This document is intended to provide an overview and reference guide for how boats go together
      and how we should be repairing boats and other bits of kit. This covers the whole range of scales
      from ongoing care to catastrophic damage. Ideally this means that jobs can be delegated while
      maintaining a consistent approach and effective knowledge transfer.
